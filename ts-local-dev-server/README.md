A local development server

Using:
- Java 8 (Oracle)
- Maven
- Git
- MySQL
- Elasticsearch
- MongoDB (with SSL support, making use of a self signed certificate)
- Docker

Running on: Ubuntu 14.04 64bit

## Creating and starting a Virtual Machine

- Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (skip this if Vagrant is already installed)

- Create a directory and download the Vagrant file
```bash
mkdir ts-local-dev-server
cd ts-local-dev-server
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlindooren/vagrant-playground/master/ts-local-dev-server/Vagrantfile
```

- Start vagrant (execute this command in the directory you just created)
```
vagrant up
```

- Wait a while (donâ€™t be alarmed by the output flying over your screen)

## Stopping the VM

```
vagrant halt
```

Alternatively you can also remove the VM with `vagrant destroy`

## Logging in into the VM ##

**Option 1: Letting Vagrant do the connection configuration for you**

```
vagrant ssh
```

**Option 2: Using the SSH client yourself**

```
ssh -p 2222 -i .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key vagrant@localhost
```

**Option 3: Using SSH with specific config and making use of your public key**

Copy your public key to the VM:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 2222 -i .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key vagrant@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

Add this entry to your `.ssh/config` file:
```
Host ts-local-dev-server
  User vagrant
  HostName localhost
  Port 2222
```

Now you can use: `ssh ts-local-dev-server`

## Trusting the self signed certificate used by MongoDB

- Copy the certificate from the VM

```
scp -P 2222 -i .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key vagrant@localhost:/usr/lib/ssl/certs/mongodb-cert.crt /tmp/
```

or

```
scp -P 2222 ts-local-dev-server:/usr/lib/ssl/certs/mongodb-cert.crt /tmp/
```

If you followed the SSH instructions above


- Import the certificate in Java's keystore

```
# Make a backup of the keystore (just in case)
sudo cp $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts.original
 
# Import the certificate (the default password of the keystore is 'changeit')
sudo keytool -import -alias localhost -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -file /tmp/mongodb-cert.crt
```

The commands above are based on Mac OSX

Note: when you update your JDK the certificate has to be trusted again (the new JDK comes with a fresh keystore)

## Hints

**Locale on iTerm**

On Mac OSX it's possible that you get a like this after logging in with SSH:

"WARNING! Your environment specifies an invalid locale."

You can prevent this by not letting iTerm set the locale:
